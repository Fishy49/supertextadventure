# SuperTextAdventure

Welcome, ye adventurer!
SuperTextAdventure is three things:
1. An unglorified chat app.
2. A tool for telling stories with your friends.
3. The passion-project of a Ruby/Rails nerd.

The hope is that this application can provide a way to have a D&D-like experience in a nostalgic setting like the text-adventures of olde. It's also hoped that this application will provide a great example of what Rails 7 can do!

## Setup
Simply clone the repo and install with `./bin setup && rails db:migrate`.

## Running
The application can be run with `./bin dev`.

## Roadmap
