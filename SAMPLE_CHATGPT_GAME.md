#-- AND SO IT BEGINS --

Welcome to the world of The Cave of Monsters, a dangerous dungeon filled with all kinds of creatures and challenges waiting to be conquered by brave adventurers like you. In this world, magic is real, and the unknown is lurking around every corner. You and your companions are about to embark on a perilous journey into a deep, dark cave. Whether you make it out alive or not, one thing is for sure: your actions will change the fate of this world forever. As you approach the cave entrance, you can feel the chill in the air emanating from the darkness. The sky overhead is cloudy, and a light rain begins to fall. You notice that the cave appears to be quite deep, and you can barely see its end in the distance. A few twisted trees and some moss-stone formations are scattered around the entrance, but there is no sign of any recent activity.
Welcome, Frank The Mighty! You are a sight to behold as you stand with your leather armor and greatsword in hand. With your impressive stature, your companions feel a sense of security knowing you are on their side. As you approach the entrance to the cave, you grip your sword tighter, ready for whatever monster may come your way. What would you like to do next?

Frank The Mighty /> I WOULD LIKE TO SHOUT "HELLO" INTO THE CAVE.

With a deep breath, you shout into the cave, "HELLO!" Your voice echoes off the walls, creating an eerie resonance. As the echo dies down, there is no immediate response. However, you hear a faint rustling noise coming from the depths of the cave. You cannot make out what it is, but you have the feeling that you are not alone in this cave. What would you like to do next?

Frank The Mighty /> I MOVE DEEPER INTO THE CAVE.

You step into the cave, following the sounds of the rustling. Your eyes slowly adjust to the dim light, and you observe that the walls of the cave are slick with moisture. There appears to be a path leading deeper into the cave, and you can hear the rustling getting louder as you progress. You soon find yourself in a cavern, and in front of you is a pack of hungry looking wolves! They seem agitated by your presence and start to growl menacingly. What would you like to do?

Frank The Mighty /> I ATTACK THE WOLVES WITH MY SWORD

You charge towards the wolves with your sword, ignoring their growls and barks. The pack of wolves attack as you approach with teeth bared, but your swift sword movements deflect their snaps and claws. You strike back and take down two of the wolves with your blade, while the others scatter back into the darkness from whence they came. As their howls fade deeper into the cave, you catch a glimpse of an object lying on the ground. It appears to be a tattered leather bag. What would you like to do next?

Frank The Mighty /> I LOOK INSIDE THE TATTERED LEATHER BAG

You search the tattered leather bag, and inside, you find a small vial of glowing liquid. The liquid seems to shimmer and pulse with a faint energy. It is difficult to tell what the liquid does without further investigation, but it appears to be some sort of magical potion. You notice that there is a symbol etched onto the vial, but it is not a symbol you recognize. As you are inspecting the vial, you hear a faint melody coming from deeper in the cave. The melody is haunting but beautiful, and it's unlike anything you've heard before. You recognize that if you wish to seek out the source of the melody, you will need to delve deeper into the cave. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty?

Frank The Mighty /> I PUT THE VIAL IN MY POCKET AND HEAD DEEPER INTO THE CAVE.

You slip the glowing vial into your pocket, ready to use it if the need arises, and continue deeper into the cave. You make your way through twists and turns, squeezing past narrow passages, and climbing over rugged terrain. The melody you heard earlier grows louder, and eventually, you find yourself standing in front of a large cavern. The melody is coming from deep within the cave, and there is no sign of any monsters around. You take a deep breath and prepare to move forward. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty?

Frank The Mighty /> DOES THE MELODY REMIND ME OF A SONG I KNOW?

You try to recall if the melody you hear reminds you of a song you know, but you cannot seem to place it. The melody is hauntingly beautiful and seems to come from the very walls of the cavern. It's as if the melody was beckoning you to come closer. You feel an overwhelming urge to investigate, but you also know that this could be a trap laid by the creatures that may lurk within the cave. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty?

Frank The Mighty /> I COVER MY EARS AND HEAD DEEPER INTO THE CAVE.

Ignoring the pull of the melody, you cover your ears and move deeper into the cave. As you make your way down the narrow tunnel, the melody slowly fades away, and you feel a sense of relief wash over you. After a few minutes of walking, you suddenly hear the sound of scurrying feet up ahead. Cautiously moving forward, you come across a group of goblins who were hiding around the corner, seemingly startled by your arrival. They appear to be unarmed, but you notice that they're all wearing armor made piecemeal from bits of metal and leather scavenged from various sources. They eye you warily, not quite sure what to make of you. What would you like to do, Frank The Mighty?

Frank The Mighty /> SAY "HELLO, I MEAN YOU NO HARM" AND SMILE.

You let your guard down and approach the goblins with a friendly demeanor, assuring them that you mean them no harm by saying, "Hello. I mean you no harm." and giving them a smile. The goblins collectively relax, sensing no immediate danger from you. One of them steps forward and speaks in a language you don't understand. However, you are able to keep the conversation going with signals, drawings, and gestures. The goblins explain to you that they have been living in this cave and have been trying to make it their own for quite some time. They say that there are many dangerous creatures deeper in the cave, and they advise you to be very careful. As you talk, you notice that one of the goblins wears a shiny gold necklace around his neck. Perhaps this remarkable jewel could be of use to you. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty?

Frank The Mighty /> I OFFER TO TRADE THE JEWEL FOR THE VIAL IN MY POCKET.

The goblin looks at you, considering your trade offer. He nods his head and beckons you to come closer. As you approach, he makes it clear that he wants to see the vial first. You take out the vial from your pocket and show it to him. The goblin strokes his chin and thinks for a moment before agreeing to the trade. You make the exchange, giving him the vial in exchange for the shiny gold necklace. The goblin hands you the necklace, then scurries off into the darkness. As he goes, he gives you one last piece of advice: "Be careful! There are powerful beasts even deeper in the cave." Now, with the shiny necklace in your possession, you feel a sense of accomplishment. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty?

Frank The Mighty /> I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO DANCE VICTORIOUSLY.

Amused by your sudden celebration, your companions join in for a moment, celebrating the successful trade with the goblin. As the cave echoes with your joyous shouts, you suddenly hear a loud roar coming from deeper in the cave. The roar sounds like it belongs to a very large and very angry creature. Your celebration comes to an abrupt end, and you all turn to face the darkness ahead. You get the sense that the beasts the goblin warned you about are nearby. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty?

<USER JOINS GAME>

Welcome, Susan The Swift! You join Frank The Mighty and his companions just as they hear a loud roar coming from deeper in the cave. You see that the group is tense and on high alert, ready for whatever comes their way. What would you like to do now that you have joined the group?

Susan The Swift /> I SAY "COME ON!" AND LEAD THE WAY DEEPER IN THE CAVE

With bravery and determination, you take the lead and stride deeper into the cave. The group follows and as you make progress, the sound of the beast grows louder. You suddenly find yourselves standing in front of a large opening to a cavern. As you look ahead, you see a creature the likes of which you've never seen before. It is massive and covered in thick, scaly skin with a long, pointed tail. It sees you and let out another ear-shattering roar. The fight ahead will be difficult, but you and your companions are ready for the challenge. What would you like to do, Susan The Swift?

Frank The Mighty /> I WHISPER TO SUSAN THAT SHE SHOULD HIDE TO GET A BETTER 
CHANCE OF SHOOTING THE BEAST WITH ARROWS.
You whisper to Susan The Swift that she should hide to get a better chance of shooting the beast with her arrows. Susan nods and goes to look for cover. She moves with such incredible speed and grace that she virtually disappears from sight. Using her excellent skills in archery, she readies her bow and arrows from hidden cover to take aim at the monster. Feeling confident now that Susan has established a good vantage point, you draw your sword and shield, preparing to engage in melee combat with the beast. The creature begins its attack, charging towards you with teeth bared and claws at the ready. What would you like to do, Frank The Mighty?

Frank The Mighty /> I SWING MY SWORD AT THE BEAST

You charge forth, brandishing your sword in front of you. As the beast moves towards you, you take a swing at it with your sword. While your blade strikes true, the creature's thick skin deflects most of the blow, dealing only a minor wound. The beast roars in anger and prepares to attack again. Susan takes the opportunity to launch an arrow from cover, which lands true, hitting the creature right in the eye. Its anger now focused on Susan, it charges towards the archer. However, with the creature's attention now towards Susan, you see an opening to strike again. What would you like to do, Frank The Mighty?

Frank The Mighty /> I STRIKE QUICKLY AND TRY TO DRAW ITS ATTENTION

You take advantage of the creature's distraction towards Susan and quickly charge towards it. With a swift swing of your sword, you aim for its tail hoping to draw its attention back to you. Your hit lands true, and the monster howls in pain as it turns towards you. It's now agitated and distracted, giving Susan a chance to launch another shot. She takes aim again, waiting for the perfect moment, then in a swift and fluid motion, lets her arrow fly at the beast. It hits its mark yet again, striking the monster in a vulnerable spot. With another loud roar, the creature lashes out at Susan, clawing and bashing against everything it can reach. Its focus now shifted to Susan, you have an opportunity to land the final blow. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty?

Susan The Swift /> I SET FIRE TO MY ARROWS SO THEY WILL DO  MORE DAMAGE

Susan, taking advantage of the creature's focus on her, takes out a flask of oil from her quiver and coats her arrows with it. She then carefully sets them ablaze with a lighter. She takes aim once more at the roaring beast, waits for the perfect moment, and lets loose her fiery arrow. The arrow pierces the scaled skin of the creature and as it lands, the oil ignites, engulfing the monster in flames. The beast lets out a final, deafening roar, then falls to the ground with a thud, motionless. Your group's victory is met with cheers of triumph, and you all breathe a sigh of relief. You have vanquished the great beast and it's clear that your teamwork has paid off. Now, with the creature defeated, you can now search the surrounding area, seeking additional treasure or clues as to what lies deeper in the cave. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty and Susan The Swift?

Susan The Swift /> I SEARCH THE BEAST


Frank The Mighty /> I SEARCH THE ROOM

You search the monster's body and find a collection of shiny jewels that it swallowed. Though the process is disgusting, you manage to retrieve the shiny stones for later inspection. You also notice that the creature had a large wound on its side as you examine its body, and it looks to have been there for quite some time. You get the sense that there may be something else down here in the cave. Maybe this wound indicates that something else is hunting these creatures, and perhaps it could pose a danger to you as well. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty and Susan The Swift?
After taking a moment to catch your breath, you and Susan The Swift begin to search the area. As you search the beast, you find various trinkets and trophies, including talons, and a large bone that looks to have come from another creature. However, upon searching the room, you find several items of interest. You notice a pile of rubble in the corner, which seems to be hiding something beneath it. After moving the rocks out of the way, you discover a chest containing a gleaming golden chainmail. It would be a valuable addition to any warrior's collection, but who will claim it? In addition to the chest, you also find a glowing stone statue with a strange inscription. The inscription reads, "Only those who can prove their worth shall pass". It's unclear what the riddle means, but you have a feeling that it is somehow related to the deeper parts of the cave. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty and Susan The Swift?

Frank The Mighty /> I TAKE THE CHAINMAIL

You claim the gleaming golden chainmail, and you feel the weight of the valuable item on your shoulders. You put it on, and you notice that it fits you well, as if it was made specifically for you. The golden hues of the armor glisten in the dim light, and you feel stronger and more confident with it on. The adventurers can't help but feel a little envious of your new armor. As you put on the chainmail, you notice that the inscription on the glowing stone statue pulses with a brighter light. Perhaps wearing the chainmail had something to do with it. It seems that it might be related to the riddle in some way. What would you like to do next, Frank The Mighty and Susan The Swift?
